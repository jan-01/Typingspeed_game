# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# ‚ö° TypeSpeed Game

A clean, minimalistic typing speed test app built with **React** and **Node.js (Express)**, designed to measure your words-per-minute (WPM) typing speed ‚Äî without annoying ads or clutter.

## üéØ Why I Built This

I created this project to:

- **Learn and apply new web development concepts** like React hooks, Node.js Express API, file-based persistence, and frontend-backend integration.
- Build a clean, distraction-free typing test tool that works locally and lets you track high scores.
- Practice making a complete full-stack app with data persistence and responsive UI.

## üöÄ Features

- Random sentence generation for typing.
- Real-time WPM calculation.
- Timer that starts with your first keystroke.
- Submit your name and score on finishing.
- Top 5 high scores leaderboard sorted by WPM.
- Backend saves scores in a local `scores.json` file.
- Simple, clean UI without ads or unnecessary distractions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite, JSX, hooks)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Data Storage**: JSON file persistence (local)
- **Styling**: Inline + CSS classes
